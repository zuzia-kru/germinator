# Germinator
Using Raspberry Pi to keep track of germinating flower seeds.

# First Iteration
For the first iteration of automating our urban garden we wrote this simple program that uses a Raspberry Pi Camera to take a photo of germinating seeds every 3 minutes during daylight and uploads it to Dropbox so that we can track how the germination is going wherever we are.
